		<h1 class="major">POV and locality By Mitra Azar</h1>
		<p>Draft contribution for the collective writing run by Bernard Stielger towards the
		publishing of a memorandum for Geneva 2020 ONU gathering. The chapter of the
		memorandum about locality is lead by Paolo Vignola.</p>
		<p>To think about locality means to think about the means of production and the means of
		exchange of locality within a negative phenomenology that aims at defining locality
		approaching what locality pretends to be in the current political global scenario. The
		concept of locality is currently appropriated by various virulent forms of technofascisms
		that obscure the emancipatory meaning of locality as such. Thus, by
		disclosing how techno-fascisms are corrupting the notion of locality we hope to be
		able to propose a different notion of locality capable of facing the planetary challenges
		ahead of us. The idea is that of understanding how locality comes into being from
		understanding how locality is not brought into being. The task, indeed, is that of
		charting a symptomatology of the virulent diffusion of a poisoned version of locality
		towards de-construct it and re-invent it from its ashes, turning it into the pivotal
		concept of a community and politics to come.</p>
		<p>Within the politics of Trump, Salvini, May, LePen, and Bolsonaro, locality defines a
		collectivity based on the principle of identity and in relation to an outer alterity which is
		allegedly threatening the identity of the collectivity itself. The identity is actually built
		around the fear of an alterity always seen as colonizing force that aims at taking over
		both language and territory - the main technological and geographical extensions
		through which western techno-fascist locality tries to define itself.</p>
		<p>
		On one side, territory is defined by borders that regulate the flux of alleged alterity
		within the community constituting itself inside these borders. This idea of borders and
		alterity constitutes as a consequence the idea of the immigrant as a danger threatening
		the safety of the collectivity.</p>
		<p>
		On the other side, language becomes the frozen expressive instantiation of locality, and
		manifests according to a standardization operated both by human and algorithmic
		agencies producing the shrinking of the very capability of expression itself - which is
		that of producing differences both in the syntax and in the semantic of the act of
		linguistic expression itself.</p>
		<p>
		This type of locality increases economic and ecological entropy because while
		pretending to produce a strategy towards order achieves exactly the opposite, and
		does so by reducing, containing and destroying differences that could instead produce
		bifurcations enabling temporary structure of orders (or temporary neganthropic
		structures) supporting new imaginaries and strategies of resistance against the current
		economical, socio-political, and ecological crises.</p>
		<p>
		Techno-fascisms produce a misleading notion of locality based on identity and territory
		and by doing so increase our entropic footprint on the planet accelerating (and some
		time designing) the destruction of bio-diversity and noo-diversity.</p>
		<p>
		Nevertheless, a different idea of locality is possible as the ground from where to rethink
		our techno-ecological relation with nature and the human. Locality is first and
		above all the emergency of an orientation, of a point of view, which is a bifurcation, or
		the emergency of a difference as the place where a phase-shift happens in the
		structure of matter producing a dimensionality which is singular and collective at the
		same time. Locality, indeed, becomes the engine of difference itself, a difference
		constituting itself as singularity produced by the field which surrounds it.
		Locality is thus relational and functions as the place of activation on another (different)
		dimension of the field - which is itself the product of another differential produced by
		another locality on another dimension of the field. Difference is indeed always
		differential and related to another difference, rather then to the existence of an preconstituted
		identity. Differently from the territory around which the current mystified
		version of locality is geographically inscribed, the field has no boundaries, or borders,
		and locality becomes performative through the field and the expressive quality of the
		field itself.</p>
		<p>
		Localities are, thus, all conjuncted by differential relations and can constitute zones of
		differential enhancement where bifurcations towards neganthropy thrive increasingly
		re-establishing bio-diversity and noo-diversity. Identities, instead, are connective rather
		then conjunctive, because relate to each other in binary terms (in/out “local”/ stranger)
		through the use of language as one of the main mechanism of this binary inclusion/
		exclusion system.</p>
		<p>
		A differential notion of locality, instead, adopts language as the techno-operational
		ground for the externalization of the differential fabric connecting the emergencies of
		localities, and contributes to the expansions of the fields surrounding them.
		The interaction between the fields requires an ecology of localities which harnesses the
		means of exchange of localities between each other and between their surroundings.
		Most importantly, we need to understand how the means of exchange can be possibly
		harnessed to maneuver the transition from a reactionary (fascist) and entropic concept
		of locality towards a differential, performative and neganthropic notion of locality.
		Finally, a negative phenomenology should turn into a cosmo-phenomenology rooted in
		a notion of cosmo-technology that requires a parallel notion of cosmo-locality as the
		engine for the proliferation of a differential ontology and of an ontological eroticism able
		to re-articulate the forces that can bring new radical techno-localities into being.
