<p>On the 100th anniversary of the League of Nations (Friday, 10 January 2020), we hope to launch a discussion in Geneva, at the level of the United Nations, on the economic challenges of the Anthropocene. This event, the 100th anniversary of the League of Nations in January 2020, will consist in an official submission to the UN of a Memorandum articulating the scientific, legal, political, technological and economic issues, and doing so with respect to a concept developed by Marcel Mauss (1920) in the context of the creation of the League of Nations. </p>
<p>The concept of “nation” in the League of Nations was rejected by the Socialist International in the name of “proletarian internationalism”. In this debate, Mauss distinguished his position by arguing that the nation cannot be dissolved into the international, and by proposing to refer to the internation rather than to internationalism.</p>
<p>In a context where irresponsible globalization is today giving rise to regressive social reactions based on fictional scapegoats, we believe that there is no answer other than to genuinely address the challenges of the Anthropocene, whose toxicity has resulted in an irrational economic organization incapable of rethinking economics and the economy.</p>
<h2 class="major">Our goal</h2>
<p>We consider the Anthropocene to be the problem of an increase of entropy in all its forms (thermodynamic, biological and informational), and we believe that the economy must be reorganized in order to reduce entropy, and to increase negentropy in the sense of Schrödinger and anti-entropy in the sense of Bailly, Longo and Montévil. Negentropy and anti-entropy can, however, be qualified only from a local point of view. This means that locality must be reconceptualized in terms of levels of localities.</p>
<p>All this requires an investment in an extensive research program, resting on new theoretical axioms and new methodologies. The role of this Memorandum of Understanding is to provide a theoretical platform - axioms on entropy and neguenthropy - according to which many disciplinary fields can work together, and elements of a methodology enabling to practice transdisciplinary and contributory research. Our goal is to make concrete proposals based on explicit concepts (i.e. anti-entropy, locality, Neganthropocene, internation) leading to rational and achievable processes and opening better future prospects.</p>
<p>Concerning the theoretical dimension, we want to address the epistemological and epistemic questions that arise in the context of the Anthropocene, in particular, the questions of negentropy and anti-entropy in the fields of thermodynamics, biology, information theory and economy in order to form a new framework through which a new macro-economic program can be elaborated at the level of the internation.</p>
<p>Concerning the practical or methodological dimension, we maintain that in the state of emergency that now characterizes the biosphere, research must be launched with contributory methodologies and technologies which allow a rapid transindividuation into society of these scientific questions, operating via social experimentation – for which the Plaine Commune program tries to be not a model, but a matrix.</p>
